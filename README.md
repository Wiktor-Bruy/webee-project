# Coffe Joy

The coffee shop website is a unique gallery, where each section is a
sophisticated photo dedicated to the aesthetics of coffee, and interactive
elements smoothly reveal information about brewing, reviews and the philosophy
of the establishment. We present the site as an interactive map, where the
destination is the coffee shop. By marking it, the user on the way will be able
to study the reviews of previous "travelers" and immediately get all the
contacts for communication.
